# PRODIGY_ML_01
This project leverages Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to develop a robust linear regression model for predicting house prices. By analyzing key property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms, the model aims to provide accurate price estimates.

Key Features and Python Libraries
  Data Handling with Pandas and NumPy
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing tasks such as loading datasets, handling missing values, and performing data transformations.

NumPy: Provides essential functionalities for numerical computations, including array operations and mathematical functions used in data preprocessing and model training.

Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Matplotlib: Enables creation of static, animated, and interactive visualizations, used here to plot data distributions, regression results, and evaluation metrics graphs.
Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn enhances visualizations with attractive statistical graphics. It is utilized for creating informative visual summaries, including scatter plots, regression plots, and distribution plots.

Machine Learning with Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn: Integrates various machine learning algorithms and tools for data mining and data analysis tasks. In this project:
Linear regression model (LinearRegression) is employed for predicting house prices based on input features.
Data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score (metrics) are computed to assess model performance.
